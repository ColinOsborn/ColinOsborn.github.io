                <h6>Written by <a href="#">Colin Osborn</a> on March 2nd, 2016.</h6>

                  <div class="large-6 columns">
                    <p>So finally, here's my new blog/site. Technically I still hate the term blog, but this certainly isn't a full fledged site, yet. But for the time being here is where I hope to showcase most of what I'm leanring/working on as somewhat as a blog/resume/portfolio. I've been wanting to do this for quite a while, but finally I have learned and understood enough to make this passable to post up for people to actually see.</p>
                    <p>As a bit of an update since my last post, (over a year ago) I have been pushing hard with school and working on my future career as a Web Developer. It's something I have been thinking about for a long time, but have finally gone full speed with it. In years past I've been so busy or pre-occupied that I was never really making much progress. Finally after a forced break from riding and racing, I took the time needed to actually make progress. </p>
                    <p>Speaking of racing... My 2015 season should have been amazing. I had more support than ever from the Giant Co-Factory Off Road team with lots of amazing sponsors, and supporting staff. I was provided the best bikes out there with the best equipment available. However my body had other plans. After a few years essentially putting a band-aid on a couple of biomechanical issues had finally caught up with me and created lots of problems come January 2015. Sadly, I never was able to get my problems sorted out to the point of having a race where I really felt like I was riding 100%.</p>

                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>Thankfully the season wasn't a complete waste and was able to attend a ton of races, but sadly, my performance was far from what I expect from myself, so I was left pretty disappointed after every event. While there were a few glimmers of hope with some results or moments where things seemed to be getting better, they were quickly disappering creating more frustration.</p>
                <p>This is a new fucking paragraph to add in my new shit! Enjoy it!
